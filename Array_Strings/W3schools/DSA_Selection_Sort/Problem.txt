Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,5]
Explanation: Note that the values of nums are not necessairly unique.
 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
-5 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104

Ý tưởng:
1: An array with values to sort
2: An inner loop that goes through the array, finds the lowest value, and moves it to the front of the array. This
loop through one less value each time it runs.
3: An outer loop that controls how many times the inner loop must run. For an array with n values, this outer loop 
must run n - 1 times
